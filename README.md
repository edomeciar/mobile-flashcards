## Udacity project

## Mobile Flashcards

This application was created by expo-cli and I have used basic navigation template. But later I have deleted it created my own navigation. Application is using react-native and react-navigation. I tried to use redux, but at the end I devcided to use only AsyngStorage.

### Instructions to run the application

In order to run the project, clone the repository

`git clone https://github.com/edomeciar/mobile-flashcards.git`

Then switch to the cloned directory

`cd mobile-flashcards`

And install the dependecies

`yarn install`

Then you will be able to run the project by executing

`npm run ios`

OR

`npm run`

OR

`expo start --ios`

I have done all my testing in the iOS simulator.
